# Warhammer Website

**Introduction:**
This project was created as part of the UI1 course during the first year at KdG. The objective was to design and develop a website on a chosen topic, and for this project, I selected Warhammer as the subject matter. Due to specific course requirements, the website might appear somewhat unconventional, but it serves as a demonstration of my foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Getting Started:**
To view this website, simply open the provided HTML file (index.html) in a web browser. No additional installation or setup is required.

**Credits:**
- This project was created by Kobe Ponet.
- Warhammer images and content are the intellectual property of Games Workshop Group PLC.

**License:**
This project is for educational purposes only and does not intend to infringe on any copyrights. Please refer to Games Workshop's licensing and copyright policies if you plan to use any Warhammer-related content for commercial purposes.
